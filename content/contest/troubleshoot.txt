Pre-submit:
    Write a few test cases
    INCLUDE MAX CASES.
    Is memory fine?
    Overflow?
    Correct file?
Wrong answer:
    Print your solution + Print debug
    Clearing all structures between test cases?
    Can your code handle the whole input range?
    Read the problem statement again.
    Do you handle all corner cases correctly?
    Have you understood the problem correctly?
    Uninitialized variables?
    Overflows?
    Confusing N and M, i and j, etc.?
    Are you sure your algorithm works?
    Any very special cases?
    Do you know how the STL functions you use work?
    Add some assertions, maybe resubmit.
    Create some testcases
    Go through the algorithm for a simple case.
    Go through this list again.
    Explain your algorithm to a teammate.
    Ask the teammate to look at your code.
    Go for a small walk, e.g. to the toilet.
    Is your output format correct? (whitespace)
    You/Teammate rewrite solution from the start
Runtime error:
    Have you tested all corner cases locally?
    Any uninitialized variables?
    Are you reading or writing outside of range?
    Consider increasing the size of your vectors
    Any assertions that might fail?
    Any possible division by 0? (mod 0 for example)
    Any possible infinite recursion?
    Invalidated pointers or iterators?
    Are you using too much memory?
Time limit exceeded:
    Do you have any possible infinite loops?
    What is the complexity of your algorithm?
    Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data?
    How big is the input and output?
    Avoid vector, map. (use arrays/unordered_map)
    What do your teammates think about your algorithm?
Memory limit exceeded:
    Max amount of memory your code should need?
    Clearing all data structures between test cases?
